# EVALuating Real-Time Probablistic Forecast

This repository contains the accompanying software for the paper "[Evaluating real-time probabilistic forecasts with application to National Basketball Association outcome prediction](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2021.1967781?journalCode=utas20)" by Chi-Kuang Yeh, Gregory Rice and Joel A. Dubin.

## Installation

Currently evalRTPF is only available in R. We plan to deveol the Python, Julia and/or Matlab versions in the future.

`devtools::install_github("chikuang/evalRTPF")`

## Description

We develop a method to quantify the difference between two sets of probabilistic forecasts in square normed space, along with the graphical representations.

## Examples

Will be added soon.
