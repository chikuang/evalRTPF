## Description

We develop methods to quantify the difference between two sets of probabilistic forecasts in square normed space, along with the graphical representations.

## Installation

Currently evalRTPF is only available in R. We plan to develop Python, Julia and/or Matlab versions in the future.

```r
devtools::install_github("chikuang/evalRTPF")
```

## Examples

Will be added soon.

## TODO
+ [ ] Add examples with graphical illustrations
+ [ ] Add detailed descriptions
+ [ ] Speed-up with RCPP components
+ [ ] Upload to CRAN
