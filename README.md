# EVALuating Real-Time Probablistic Forecast

Chi-Kuang Yeh, Gregory Rice and Joel A. Dubin

---

## Description

We develop methods to quantify the difference between two sets of probabilistic forecasts in square normed space, along with the graphical representations.

## Installation

Currently evalRTPF is only available in R. We plan to develop Python, Julia and/or Matlab versions in the future.

```r
devtools::install_github("chikuang/evalRTPF")
```

## Examples

Will be added soon.
